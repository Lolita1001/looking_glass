            The Nicolesy Preset Previewer is a way for you to preview many of the <a href="https://store.nicolesy.com/collections/lut-files">LUT preset packs</a> in the Nicolesy Store with your own photographs before you purchase them.

        <h4>
            How do I get started?
        </h4>
        <p>
            To get started, first you will need to create a user account. Then, click the upload button at the top and select a file you wish to preview.

        <h4>
            Are my photos safe?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Yes! Any photo you upload here will only be used on this site for you to preview the preset packs. I do not and will not use your photos without your permission. Also, each time you upload a photo, the previous images is deleted and
            removed from the database.
